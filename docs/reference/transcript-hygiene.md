# Transcript Hygiene (Provider Fixups)

This document describes **provider-specific fixes** applied to transcripts before a run
(building model context). These are **in-memory** adjustments used to satisfy strict
provider requirements. These hygiene steps do **not** rewrite the stored JSONL transcript
on disk; however, a separate session-file repair pass may rewrite malformed JSONL files
by dropping invalid lines before the session is loaded. When a repair occurs, the original
file is backed up alongside the session file.

Scope includes:

- Tool call id sanitization
- Tool call input validation
- Tool result pairing repair
- Turn validation / ordering
- Thought signature cleanup
- Image payload sanitization

## Where this runs

All transcript hygiene is centralized in the embedded runner:

- Policy selection: `src/agents/transcript-policy.ts`
- Sanitization/repair application: `sanitizeSessionHistory` in `src/agents/pi-embedded-runner/google.ts`

The policy uses `provider`, `modelApi`, and `modelId` to decide what to apply.

Separate from transcript hygiene, session files are repaired (if needed) before load:

- `repairSessionFileIfNeeded` in `src/agents/session-file-repair.ts`
- Called from `run/attempt.ts` and `compact.ts` (embedded runner)

---

## Global rule: image sanitization

Image payloads are always sanitized to prevent provider-side rejection due to size
limits (downscale/recompress oversized base64 images).

Implementation:

- `sanitizeSessionMessagesImages` in `src/agents/pi-embedded-helpers/images.ts`
- `sanitizeContentBlocksImages` in `src/agents/tool-images.ts`

---

## Global rule: malformed tool calls

Assistant tool-call blocks that are missing both `input` and `arguments` are dropped
before model context is built. This prevents provider rejections from partially
persisted tool calls (for example, after a rate limit failure).

Implementation:

- `sanitizeToolCallInputs` in `src/agents/session-transcript-repair.ts`
- Applied via `session-tool-result-guard` in `src/agents/session-tool-result-guard.ts`

---

## Provider matrix (current behavior)

Local-only builds support `ollama` models only.

- Image sanitization only.
- Tool result pairing repair runs when tool results are missing or mismatched.
- No provider-specific turn reordering or model-specific sanitizers.

---

## Historical behavior (pre-2026.1.22)

Before the 2026.1.22 release, OpenClaw applied multiple layers of transcript hygiene:

- A **transcript-sanitize extension** ran on every context build and could:
  - Repair tool use/result pairing.
  - Sanitize tool call ids (including a non-strict mode that preserved `_`/`-`).
- The runner also performed provider-specific sanitization, which duplicated work.
- Additional mutations occurred outside the provider policy, including:
  - Stripping `<final>` tags from assistant text before persistence.
  - Dropping empty assistant error turns.
  - Trimming assistant content after tool calls.

This complexity caused cross-runtime regressions (notably `call_id|fc_id`
pairing in the legacy responses adapter). The 2026.1.22 cleanup removed the extension,
centralized logic in the runner, and made chat-completions compatible responses
**no-touch** beyond image sanitization.
