# TOOLS.md - User Tool Notes (editable)

This file is for _your_ notes about external tools and conventions.
It does not define which tools exist; OpenClaw provides built-in tools internally.

## Examples

### imsg

- Send an iMessage/SMS: describe who/what, confirm before sending.
- Prefer short messages; avoid sending secrets.

### sherpa-onnx-tts

- Local text-to-speech: specify voice and output target (speaker/file).

Add whatever else you want the assistant to know about your local toolchain.
